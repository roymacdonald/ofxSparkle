# ofxSparkle

OpenFrameworks addon that adds the Sparkle framework to the project. Only for Macos.

This is just a thin C++ wrapper for the Sparkle.framework.

## Important
Remember to generate the project with project generator.

If you use Xcode, it will automatically add the Sparle framework to the app bundle.

If you want to use Make, VSCode, etc, you need to copy the Sparkle.framework into the app bundle. 

Then just follow the Sparkle guidelines.
